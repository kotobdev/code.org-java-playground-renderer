# code.org-java-playground-renderer
A small test with lighting in the Code.Org pilot program Java playground (lesson 12)

This is the code used for a light renderer in the Code.Org Java Playground.
if you're able to access it (unlikely), the code is meant for Lesson 12 or 13. Just replace the code in the preexisting files with this, and create new files as needed.
